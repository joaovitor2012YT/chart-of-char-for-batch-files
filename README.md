An good &amp; old set of Unicode characters.

## Use the batbox thing, if you're based in "0xb2" (DOS Baltic Font) you have to use "Him" (him = batbox) like this:
## Batbox /c 0x4f /g 10 10 /d "%windir%"
## So, if we mind that "4" is Red and "f" is Bright White in the set of "color" command, now we know that "/C 0X4F" means "/Color red for the background, white for text."
## Oh yea, now the c:/windows is white!
